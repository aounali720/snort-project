## Objective


The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting malicious network packets . The primary focus was to monitor and analyze network traffic within snort tool and forwarded the alerts using Snort-Forwarder  to a  Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (Splunk Enterprise), generating test telemetry to mimic real-world network scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, network traffic , and defensive strategies.


### Skills Learned


- Advanced understanding of SIEM(Splunk Enterprise) concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to analyze and recognize attack signatures and patterns in network.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Snort Installation and Configuration:
- Proficiency in setting up and configuring Snort as an IDS on Ubuntu.
- Ability to define network variables and write rules to detect TCP and ICMP traffic.
  
- Network Traffic Analysis
- Understanding how to monitor and analyze network traffic using Snort.
- Skill in identifying suspicious activity within TCP and ICMP protocols and generating alerts accordingly.
  
- SIEM Integration

- Experience in configuring Snort to forward alerts to Splunk Enterprise for centralized log management.
- Ability to set up data inputs in Splunk to receive and index security alerts.
- Hands-on Threat Detection:

- Practical experience in simulating and detecting real-time network threats.
- Skill in analyzing logs, events, and alerts within a SIEM system for security monitoring.
- Linux System Administration:

- Competency in using Ubuntu for security tools setup and network monitoring.
- Experience with managing system configurations, services, and logs related to Snort and Splunk.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Snort:An open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) used to monitor and analyze network traffic, focusing on detecting TCP and ICMP traffic, and generating alerts based on specific rules.
- Splunk Enterprise:A powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system used for centralized log management, analysis, and real-time visualization of security events. It ingests and analyzes the alerts generated by Snort.
- Ubuntu:The Linux-based operating system used as the environment for installing and running both Snort and Splunk. It serves as the platform for network monitoring and security event analysis.
- Syslog:A logging protocol used to forward Snort alerts to Splunk Enterprise for aggregation and analysis.
- Terminal (Command Line Interface):Used for installing, configuring, and running Snort and managing the Ubuntu system, including handling logs and network configurations.
- Wireshark (Optional):A network protocol analyzer that can be used alongside Snort to visually inspect network traffic for verification and debugging purposes.
