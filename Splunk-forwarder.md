# PROJECTNAME

## Objective
In this setup, an Ubuntu virtual machine is running on a Windows host, with Snort configured as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor TCP and ICMP network traffic. The goal is to detect suspicious activities and generate alerts. These alerts are forwarded to Splunk Enterprise using splunk forwarder for centralized alert collection and analysis.

### Skills Learned
- Splunk Universal Forwarder Installation:
- Knowledge of downloading, installing, and setting up the Splunk Universal Forwarder on Linux systems (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Familiarity with using command-line utilities to manage Splunk services and configurations.
- Log Forwarding Configuration:
  - Ability to configure the Universal Forwarder to send logs and data to a remote Splunk Enterprise server.
Understanding how to specify log sources and directories to monitor (e.g., Snort logs).
- Splunk Enterprise Setup:
  - Competence in configuring Splunk Enterprise to receive forwarded logs by enabling listening on a specific port.
  - Skills in searching, indexing, and managing forwarded logs for real-time data analysis.
- Snort and Log Monitoring:
  - Expertise in monitoring network traffic using Snort and identifying critical log files that need to be forwarded to a central log management system.
  - Ability to integrate Snort with Splunk for centralized alert and log analysis.
- Network and Security Skills:
  - Knowledge of detecting and analyzing network traffic, particularly TCP and ICMP, using Snort.
  - Familiarity with network security practices by monitoring and responding to Snort-generated alerts in a SIEM system like Splunk.
- System Administration and Troubleshooting:
  - Experience in managing and troubleshooting a Linux-based environment.
  - Familiarity with configuring system logs, services, and monitoring processes.
  - Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
